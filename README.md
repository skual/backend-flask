# Skual backend server
(written in Python using Flask)

## Introduction

Skual is a Database management system that brings a fresh air to what's already in place.
It aims to optimize the time spent managing your database.

The Skual backend is a REST API server build using Python and Flask.

## Required package

In order for this project to work, you need to install those packages :

 * Python (tested under 2.7)
 * Flask
 * SQLAlchemy
 * MySQL-Python (MySQL driver for Python)
 * PyCrypto

## Misc

I'm not an expert in Python, just did a few project back then.
I choosed Python+Flask because it was the fastest, nicest way to have a REST webserver build.
(And well, Python is great! :)).

So you'll probably see horrible mistakes if you are a Python guy.
If this is the case, please tell me so I can learn, or fork the project to fix them :)
